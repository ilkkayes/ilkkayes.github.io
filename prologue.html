</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I wanted to learn Python programming, but the online courses are generally booooring, and not very motivating by themselves. Also, I don't think that this kind of learning (being shown what to do, in the order dictated by someone else) is very efficient way to learn for me.</p>
<p>I decided to approach the learning as a project: Have a goal few steps away, solve it, set next goal, and repeat. This way I learn bits of Python programming that interest me, and associated stuff by accident.</p>
<p>I have often entertained myself with creating game worlds and stories in my mind, so game programming is easily approachable framework for practising programming. It is also nice to learn marketable skills, that someone will give money for, and as data and statistics are fun for me I wanted to add learning of Data Science related skills to the equation:</p>
<p><strong>Learn Python + Create game worlds + Learn Data Science + ??? = Profit</strong></p>
<p>This blog is to follow my learning in Python, Data Science and other associated things. I will document my goals, how I reached the goals, and what I learned in the process.</p>
<p>This blog is as much for myself, to solidify my learning, as it is for other people who might be interested for whatever reason.</p>
